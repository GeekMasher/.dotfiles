# My Little Box Of Linux Tricks

This is a list of scripts, tricks and help docs on my Linux adventures.

## Bash

I have both a `.bashrc` file here used to store configuration settings for Bash and a `.bash_aliases` file.
This other file is used to store all my different aliases because I'm a lazy man.

## Vim

I have both my `.vimrc` file used to configure Vim and the `.vim` folder.
This is used to store over Vim based files such as Vundle bundles and different editor schema colours.
